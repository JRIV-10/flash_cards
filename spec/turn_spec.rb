#initialize(string, card) - A turn is initialized with two arguments. 
#The first is a string representing a guess to a cardâ€™s question. 
#The second argument is a Card object representing the current flashcard being shown.
# guess - This method returns the guess
# card - This method returns the Card
# correct? - This method returns a boolean indicating if the guess matched the answer on the Card.
# feedback - This method either returns "Correct!" or "Incorrect." based on whether the guess was correct or not.
